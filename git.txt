TO upload project first time in a new repository:
(Follow guideline)
>>git init
>>git remote add origin <repository URL>
To add all files
>>git add .
or
>>git add <file names>
>>git commit -m <"Initial commit message">
>>git push -u origin master



To clone the project from repository to local:
>>git clone <projectURL>


To create .gitignore
>>touch .gitignore

To add file in .gitignore
>>echo '<fileName>'>>.gitignore


To commit files
>>git status
>>git add <cp all the required modified files>
>>git commit -m "<message>"

to check if someone has added/pushed new branch to repo and are not listed in our local git:
>>git fetch <remote>
To check the last commit comment:
>>git log --oneline master..origin/master

To pull changes from git server: 
>>git pull

If merge is required,
>>git checkout master
>>git log origin/master
>>git merge origin/master

If conflicts occurs:
To keep remote file
>>git checkout --theirs <filePath>
To keep local file
>>git checkout --ours <filePath>

IN both cases,
>>git add <changedFiles>
>>git commit -m "<message>"

To push file to remote:
>>git push origin master

To clean tree
>>git status
To show what will be deleted
>>git clean -n
To delete
>>git clean -f



To remove a file permenently from the version control (which is previously insterted)
Link: https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/

add the repository in your pc
>>git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
>>cd YOUR-REPOSITORY

remove from all version
>>git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

add file to .gitignore so by mistake it won't get commited again 
>>echo "YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA" >> .gitignore
>>git add .gitignore
>>git commit -m "Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore"

#do this for all the files you want to remove, and commit file by file
#once all changes are done,
>>git push origin --force --all
>>git push origin --force --tags
